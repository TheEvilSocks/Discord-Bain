# How to contribute

Fork this repository and find the file needing changes. All information is stored in their respective folders.  
Weapons can be found in the 'weapons' directory, for example.

From there choose the file you want to change. For example you want to update the `R93 SNIPER RIFLE`.  
You'll have to find the `r93.json` file inside the `weapons` folder and update it with the new numbers!  

Once done save the file and upload it back to github. Then just create a pull request!  
I'll check your update to make sure it's correct and merge it into Bain!  

I'll keep track of everyone who contributes. I'm still thinking about what rewards I might give out.  


## Other
When saving your new file, you can enter a description of what you changed. Please include your Discord ID in there so I can reward you.  
To get your ID just PM Bain with `!id` and It'll give you your ID!
